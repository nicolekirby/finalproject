<!-- -Your final project will be your chance to shine and showcase all your new web development skills! This web app will be something you can show friends, family and employers. You will be presenting to your class on the last day but beyond that feel free to keep working and adding to it! -->
<!-- -You can take a project that you've been working on in class or a website of your own. You can work on this project by yourself or form teams of no more than 3 people. -->
<!-- -You should try using Git + Github, either in teams or by yourself, to track issues, suggest feature enhancements and ideas, and iterate over your in-progress software. Keep track of your progress using Git. Make at least 6-10 commits as your project progresses. You don't need to make a commit for every single minor change, but instead for each set of changes that adds to your website, or "feature". Also a commit before almost any code is written, your "initial commit". This isn't a requirement, but it's good practice to use version control when working on any project.
Grading Requirements:
-Make it responsive! Have a desktop version and a mobile version at the very least, if you have time try and make a tablet version.
-Add at least one type of JavaScript or jQuery function to every page of your site.
-Make the code clean! Keep your HTML, CSS and JavaScript properly indented.
-Complete: Meets all the grading criteria above.
-Incomplete: Does not meet all the grading criteria above. Needs improvement or no submission.

					<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
						<p>My colleagues call me Nicole. Family and Friends from long ago call me Nikki. My wonderful husband calls me Nik! My favorite name to be called is mommy by my beautiful son. We reside in Staten Island New York but are originally from BROOKLYN! I work in the corporate world while my husbands a teacher but our real job is raising our 8-year-old son. We love to travel together (vacations are a must), go to the movies, family game nights and lots of playdates! My life is not all work and family! I am OBSESSED with home rehab and decorating. My husband and I purchased and now manage a few rental properties so I have rehabbed and designed several home projects. I live a very busy life but I always make time to watch HGTV to keep my decorating juices going! My new passion is home decor blogs; and it is one of the reasons I convinced my employer to pay for my Web Development 100 class. Yes, I need the class for work but most importantly I am starting my own home blog. YAY!!! Owning multiple properties gives me opportunity to blog about all my projects and express my love and passion for home decor. Look out for my blog coming soon to a browser near you! lol <br>

						I am very blessed and grateful for my fulfilled life!</p>
